# Cross Assembly in Python

Cross assembly is a way of pulling genomes from metagenomes. This is a python-ish implementation (not all of it is python) that I'm working on.

The initial steps of the cross assembly are detailed [http://tbb.bio.uu.nl/dutilh/CABBIO/](on Bas' UU page)

[CrAPy.ipynb](CrAPy.ipynb) is an ipython notebook with a lot of the implementation

[CrAPy.py](CrAPy.py) is an early linear implmentation

[CrAPy_mp.py](CrAPy_mp.py) is a multiprocessor version
